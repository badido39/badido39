# 👋 Hi, I’m Badreddine (aka @badido39)

I'm a passionate and pragmatic full-stack developer with a strong focus on the .NET ecosystem. I enjoy building robust, scalable, and modern applications using tools like **ASP.NET Core**, **Blazor**, **MAUI**, and **C#** — but I’m also exploring the world of **AI**, **IoT**, and **automation**.

## 👀 I’m interested in
- Cross-platform apps with **.NET MAUI**
- Real-time apps using **SignalR**
- AI-powered features in **.NET** applications
- **Industrial automation** with PLCs and Arduino
- Creating useful tools for **startups** and **small businesses**

## 🌱 I’m currently learning
- Integrating **custom payment gateways** in Odoo
- **LLMs & AI APIs** for exam grading and customer support automation
- Building **offline-first** apps that sync data to the cloud
- Using **Docker** for deployment and CI/CD automation

## 💬 Ask me about
- Blazor WebAssembly vs Server — I’ve done both.
- Setting up MQTT with Mosquitto for secure topic-based communication
- Real-time dashboards with SignalR
- Smart cash management with Google Sheets

## 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on
- AI-based tools for schools or incubators
- .NET MAUI mobile projects
- IoT dashboards with live sensor updates
- Open-source .NET tools that help devs be more productive
